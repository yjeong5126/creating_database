# Creating a Database and Practicing SQL Queries
This is the project to create a database using data in a spreadsheet in order to practice SQL queries.

## The Goal of this Project
The SQL skill for using a Relational Database Management System (RDMA) is required for many data-related positions these days. In the social media forums like Quora or Reddit, there are many people who search for a public database for practicing their SQL querying skills.

However, although there are many public data sets in a single spreadsheet, there are not many public databases online. Even if you found a data set for the topic you have interest in, the format of the data is usually just one spreadsheet, not a database for most cases. Therefore, it will be very useful to know how to convert a data set in one spreadsheet to a database with multiple tables fitting a relational database format. Knowing the process of this conversion can give us many chances to practice SQL querying skills with a variety of databases.

The goal of this project is to show how to convert a data in one spreadsheet to a relational database for SQL. After the database is created, I will perform several SQL queries using the database.
